# SelfMusic
⚠️ Using Selfbots on Discord is Completely Prohibited and Breaks there Terms of Services, This maybe Result in a BAN of your Account, **USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK**
- I created this just for Entertainment Purposes, I don't encourage you to use Selfbots to create trouble on public servers.

## Introduction & Uses
This Project is a **SelfMusic Bot** Coded on **[JavaScript (Discord.JS)](https://nodejs.org/)** Language. This can play Song from YouTube Search in a Voice Channel while being a Selfbot, This means it can be used as a user account playing Songs.
- This has many Uses in itself, **For Example**: You can just play Music in any Server without the Need of a Bot or Permission to Run a Bot.

## Features
This Selfbot is coded in a very Different Logic and Manner, Without the need of any Music APIs ( LavaLink, MoonLink ), This Selfbot can still Play music By Downloading that Specific Music as **mp3** And then Play it. 
- Rather Playing Music, You can Also use it as a Soundboard without Permissions, Just put the **.mp3** File in `/musics` Folder and Run the Play Command with the File Name.
- This Selfbot Also Include One of Voice Feature, **Text to Speech**, Rather Speaking as your own voice, You can just Run the command and the Selfbot will Say that Message.
- You can Also Run the Selfbot on a Different ALT Account and Give the Admin Access to your Main account, So the Bot will Function on your Commands aswell.
